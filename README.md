Assignment 2: Modelling a “Creature” Game Character [20%] 
Brief 
In Assignment 2, your challenge is to research, design and model an original 3D game creature. You are encouraged to research and reference other character designs to build and develop your concept but your game creature must be a new creation. You cannot simply remodel or copy a character from an existing computer game, animated series or movie (for example, from Pixar’s Monsters, Inc. or the Pokémon franchise).
Character Design
The definition of a ‘3D game creature’ here is broad, but essentially a creature is an animal, not a human. As in assignment 1, the surest way to arrive at an original character design is by combining different concepts; in this case different animal anatomies. Your documentation should begin by exploring a range of character concepts and animal forms.
Your creature's personality is expressed in its physical form. It could be bright, cute and cuddly, and suitable for a children’s game. It could be frightening and ferocious, or comical and caricatured. Remember though that this creature is a game character and needs to be modelled efficiently and within a polygon limit (20,000 tris). We are not aiming for photorealistic or highly detailed creations; simple characters with strong design elements suit the scope of this assignment best.
A short character description (about 200 words) describing your game character should be included in your documentation. For example: What is your creature called? What kind of game character is it - a monster, a hero, a pet? How does it move around and where does it live? Are there any environmental hazards that your creature has adapted to?
Deliverables
Submissions for this assignment should contain the following (three items):
(a) A Maya project folder with scene files
This should contain your final Maya file (though you should save earlier versions!) You are also required to submit all exported textures created for this assignment; these will be held in the sourceimages folder of your project. Note: You do not need to submit your Substance Painter Project as these files can easily exceed 100MB. However, you must make these files available upon request by your tutor.
(b) A Unity3D代 写FIT1033 Foundations of 3D S2 2024 Assignment 2: Modelling a “Creature” Game CharacterR
代做程序编程语言 Build (Mac or PC)
Importing your design into the Unity scene provided and exporting your scene as an interactive build: note, the build is not the Unity project file (you don’t need to submit the Unity project file). Please ask your tutor which build they would prefer.
(c) Documentation as a PDF document
Your documentation should contain research, references, screenshots, analysis, and descriptions of your technical decision-making process with the aim of illustrating your process for this assignment. You can include screenshots from the screen recordings you take during your modelling process (see note below) Further information on what your documentation should contain will be provided by your tutor and available on Moodle.
Note: Your screen recorded videos do not need to be submitted with your assignment, but must be made available in the event that your tutors request them when marking your work. These videos can be deleted once your assignment has been marked and feedback has been returned to you.
Submission is via Moodle. ALL submitted items must be named in a clear and logical way and compressed into a single .zip file, which should be named with the assessment number, and your name.
The maximum total file-size for this submission is 100MB.
Assessment Criteria
Your submission will be graded on the following criteria:
Quality of 3D character modelling and geometry [7 marks]

● Application of UV mapping techniques and texturing tools
● Appropriate use and consideration of 3D materials
● Application of PBR map types (Albedo colour, normal, metal, roughness, emission)
● Visual impact of your character in your final Unity Build
Written and Visual documentation [7 marks]
● Discussion of inspiration, research, design, and planning
● Coverage of 3D process (including modelling, materials, and Unity)
● Use of images/screenshots and other visual resources to illustrate workflow
● Explanation and reflection of decision-making process
